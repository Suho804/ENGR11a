                                        We first draw how the product might accomplish the prioritized task, such as tactile visualization, education for how the road works, puzzle type for entertainment, and finding the level of challenges. Implementing the feedback from Carroll Center, we decided to have a map from the realistic street map in Boston using 'Cityschema' and 'Bostonplans', the building would have a marking in braille and English, the board will be peg-filled based on different peg style for different buildings to attach to(house will be one peg, police station will be two pegs). coming up with this idea we looked at multiple existing puzzle examples such as 3D puzzles, a street model, and a Lego and combined each unique feature. Through Fusion 360 we modeled a PLA material first prototype on a Prusa Mini+ 3D printer, it took 8 hours to print. 
                                        <br>
                                        After it was printed our group was filled with the joint, size, and texture we realized that the Lego joint on the ground would only confuse the child as in reality, we don't have pegs on the ground. therefore, we needed to make a different joint for the puzzle to hold together and build up. 
                                        Because we had reached the concept of placing the road and made the modification of the building possible it was somewhat successful.

                                        The prototype was tested by a person who had never seen the puzzle before. we instructed the user to make a full puzzle as the description indented on the board. In total 6 piece was misplaced out of 18 pieces. The feedback included indented crosswalk and lines as negative space because the user might think extruded crosswalk as a wall. And there should be a feedback to the user that the puzzle piece has locked in place for security. Also, the board should be made into another puzzle for children to expend and explore different types of roads, as children may memorize shape of the road after couple of trials.

                                    <p class="card-text">
                                        After the realization of the first prototype, we decided to not have the peg to hold the buildings but to have a slot board for children to slide them around. while making this product some of the challenges we faced was how would the pieces be held in place and how would the visually impaired children know where to put specific road if they didn't know how the road works. 
                                        <br>
                                        In inorder to solve this problem, we decided to make two products, road pieces and a board. The borad would have exturtion around the edges therefore the road pieces would not silde off out of the borad. We would indent the shape of the road on the board so that visually impaired children can feel the correct direction and match up the same road piece on top. 
                                        <br>
                                        Also, because there were technological issues the existing road map view of Boston would not print even though we contacted the person with the file we decided to place only important street roads such as straight, curved, 3-way, and a roundabout. 
                                        <br>
                                        In this step one of the major changes would be eliminating the peg joints and converting them with a slot puzzle 
                                        Using existing road pieces, we built a 5 by 5 board in carbon fiber for more vivid texture using an ED printer, it took 15 hours and 55 min total to print.

                                        From the feedback from 2nd moderation, we have modified the board to have two magnets(20mm x 5mm) to secure the piece in place rather than having independent borders around the edges that would confuse children by indicating there is a fence every 4 square. The magnet will be placed inside both the board and the piece so that it will not be visible around the surface of the streets. 
                                       <br>
                                       The joint for the board would have a regular puzzle shape joint that follows the shape of the road(second image above) we are also considering having an empty border edge with a basket for decores, streets, lamps & lights(reference on the side widget)
                                       <br>
                                       In order to reduce the confusion about whether street lights should go in a traffic light, we differentiate the shape of the peg from each other, square and circular. 
                                       <br>
                                       The next thing to consider is the texture of the street and other decores. For example, we are considering to have a stickable sand paper laser cutted and applied on the street.
